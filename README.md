# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Aim
The main of this project was to create a functioning work day planner. 

## Features
The web application is based on a single page and features the current date and time, as well a list of 9 input 
areas where tasks and activites can be written down. The application also features a save button for each input 
area which allows the user to save each task that has been recorded. The tasks are saved in the local storage thus the page can be refreshed without affecting them. The iput area is color coded with green indicating future
times, pink indicating the current time, and gray indicating past times. Please See the link below for a demo of the application.
